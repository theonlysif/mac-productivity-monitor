### Activity Updates (every 30 mins)
```
This is an automated message being sent to you from Mac through your Poke API
üìä Activity Update (10:00-10:30):
‚Ä¢ 10:05 - Switched to VS Code
‚Ä¢ 10:07 - Working on: project.py

## üîå Using Without Poke

To use with iMessage or other services, modify the `send_to_poke()` function in `productivity-monitor.py`:

### iMessage Example
```python
def send_to_poke(message):
    """Send via iMessage"""
    recipient = "+1234567890"
    script = f'''
    tell application "Messages"
        set targetService to 1st account whose service type = iMessage
        set targetBuddy to participant "{recipient}" of targetService
        send "{message}" to targetBuddy
    end tell
    '''
    subprocess.run(["osascript", "-e", script])
```

### Slack Webhook Example
```python
def send_to_poke(message):
    """Send to Slack"""
    webhook_url = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"
    requests.post(webhook_url, json={"text": message})
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Security

- All data is stored locally in `/tmp/` directory
- No data is sent anywhere except your configured endpoint
- API keys are stored in plain text - keep `productivity-monitor.py` secure
- Consider using environment variables for API keys in production

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Monitor not starting
```bash
# Check LaunchAgent status
launchctl list | grep productivity

# Check for errors
cat /tmp/productivity.err
```

### No messages being sent
```bash
# Test API connection
curl 'https://poke.com/api/v1/inbound-sms/webhook' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{"message": "Test message"}'
```

### Permission issues
Go to System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Accessibility and ensure Terminal/Python has permissions.
